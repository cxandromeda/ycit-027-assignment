# YCIT-027 Assignment 1 of 1 .This is xi chen's homework

## Tasks

1. Fork the repository

**NOTE**: If you do not fork the repository, you will not get the 10%

2. Clone the repository to your local machine

3. Fix the broken image issue as shown in the screenshot "broken-image-to-fix.png". What we want, is that this broken link does not appear when we first open the page. Maybe use CSS? DOM API?

4. There is a bug on line 5 of script.js. Fix it. (HINT: we are trying to "resolve the promise to another promise")

5. Add a new feature: when we click the button "Get Cat Image" multiple times, we want to see multiple cat images. You will need to use the DOM API to add new "img" elements to the page.

6. Stage, commit and push your changes to your repository

**NOTE**: If you do not push your changes to your repository, you will not get the 10%

**PROBLEMS?**: Please write below this line if you are encountering any problems. If you detail your problems here, you will get the 10%. Just be sure to push your changes to your forked repository.

After two hours' work, I have fulfilled all the requirements.I mean the task is not that hard,but for the  part 5 I really waste two much time. firstly, I tried all the ways to get the element (<div class=".image-container">).But I failed again and again.It really makes me crazy. Finally, I changed the class name (class = "image") and my code works.
